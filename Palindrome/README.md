# Palindrome

## CodeDay Fall 2018 Advanced Computing Challenges

### ATLANTA, GA

## Introduction

A *palindrome* is a word or phrase that is the same spelled forwards as it is backwards, such as the word **racecar**. Your task is to take an array of words and find all the words that are palindromes. The driver has been written for you in Python, Java, or JavaScript (for other languages, you will need to implement your own driver).


## Task

Your task is to implement a function that will check if each word is a palindrome, and print it to the console if it is. Do **not** return an array, simply print from your implementation. If a word is not a palindrome, do nothing.

If you need help, **don't google it!** Ask a CodeDay team member who will help you solve the problem.

Good luck!
